# TypeScript Fixes for Cursuri Project

This document details the TypeScript errors that were fixed in the Cursuri project.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Empty Module Files**
   - Added necessary content to empty files that were being imported but had no content:
     - `utils/timeHelpers.ts`
     - `components/ErrorPage.tsx`
     - `components/Lesson/LessonNotFound.tsx`
     - `components/Lesson/LessonLoadingSkeleton.tsx`

2. **Parameter Handling in Next.js Page Components**
   - Fixed type errors in `app/courses/[courseId]/lessons/[lessonId]/page.tsx` related to param handling
   - Replaced the complex parameter extraction logic with a simpler solution using Promise resolution
   - Used a more type-safe approach to handle params that might be a Promise

3. **Component Props Type Issues**
   - Updated `LessonNotFound.tsx` component to include additional props like `lessonId` and `courseExists`

4. **Badge Component Imports**
   - Fixed imports for badge components in `AchievementBadge.tsx`
   - Changed from importing from the barrel file to direct imports from individual files

## Main Changes

### Parameter Handling

The pattern for safely handling params in Next.js server components was updated:

```tsx
// Old pattern with type errors
const courseId =
  typeof params === 'object' && 'courseId' in params
    ? String(params.courseId)
    : (await Promise.resolve(params)).courseId;

// New pattern that's TypeScript friendly
const resolvedParams = 'then' in params ? await params : params;
const courseId = String(resolvedParams.courseId);
```

### Badge Component Imports

The badge component imports were changed from:

```tsx
import {
  BadgeFirstCourse,
  BadgeFiveLessons,
  // ...more badges
} from '@/components/icons/svg';
```

To direct imports:

```tsx
import { BadgeFirstCourse } from '@/components/icons/svg/BadgeFirstCourse';
import { BadgeFiveLessons } from '@/components/icons/svg/BadgeFiveLessons';
// ...more badges
```

This ensures type safety by importing directly from the source files rather than relying on re-exports that might not be properly configured.

## Future Recommendations

1. When creating new components, ensure they have proper exports (using `export default` for the main component)
2. Add proper TypeScript interfaces for component props
3. For Next.js server components, use the safer parameter extraction pattern shown above
4. Consider using a structured approach for SVG components, with proper TypeScript declarations
