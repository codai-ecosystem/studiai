# Course Prerequisites System Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Course Prerequisites System for the Cursuri online course platform.

## Overview

The Course Prerequisites System allows administrators to define prerequisite courses that students should complete before accessing specific courses. This creates learning paths and ensures students have the necessary foundation before advancing to more complex topics.

## Features Implemented

1. **Type Definition**

   - Added `prerequisites` field to the `Course` type in `types/index.d.ts`
   - Defined as a string array containing prerequisite course IDs

2. **Admin Course Management**

   - Created `PrerequisitesField` component for the course editor
   - Added UI for administrators to select and manage prerequisites when creating or editing courses
   - Implemented validation to prevent circular prerequisites

3. **Course Detail View**

   - Added Prerequisites section to the Course Overview tab
   - Display all prerequisite courses with links to view them
   - Visual indicators for completed vs. outstanding prerequisites

4. **Enrollment Logic**

   - Added prerequisite checking logic before allowing course enrollment
   - Implemented `checkPrerequisites()` function in CourseEnrollment component
   - Added warning modal when prerequisites are not met

5. **User Experience**
   - Added "Check Prerequisites" button to course enrollment card
   - Implemented status indicators (completed/not completed) for prerequisites
   - Links to prerequisite courses for easy navigation

## Components Modified

1. **types/index.d.ts**

   - Added `prerequisites?: string[]` to the Course interface

2. **components/Course/fields/PrerequisitesField.tsx** (new)

   - Created a reusable component for adding/removing prerequisites

3. **components/Course/AddCourse.tsx**

   - Added state for prerequisites management
   - Updated the add/edit course forms to include prerequisites
   - Added prerequisites field in the course data

4. **components/Course/CourseOverview.tsx**

   - Added prerequisites section to display requirements
   - Implemented context-aware course name resolution
   - Added links to view prerequisite courses

5. **components/Course/CourseEnrollment.tsx**
   - Added prerequisites checking logic
   - Implemented modal to display missing prerequisites
   - Added "Check Prerequisites" button
   - Added visual indicators for completed prerequisites

## Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Learning Path Visualization**

   - Implement a visual course map showing prerequisites relationships
   - Create a directed graph visualization for learning paths

2. **Prerequisite Progress Tracking**

   - Display percentage completion for each prerequisite course
   - Show estimated time to complete all prerequisites

3. **Multi-level Prerequisites**

   - Support for nested prerequisites (prerequisites of prerequisites)
   - Advanced validation to prevent circular dependencies

4. **Suggested Learning Order**

   - Recommend optimal learning paths based on prerequisites
   - Allow alternative paths to reach the same learning goals

5. **Prerequisite Override**
   - Admin functionality to override prerequisites for specific users
   - Option for "challenge" tests to skip prerequisites
