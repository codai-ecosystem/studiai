# Next.js 15 Dynamic Parameters Fix - Lessons Page

## Issue

In Next.js 15, the lesson pages were experiencing issues where the parameters (`courseId` and `lessonId`) were being passed down to client components as undefined or as Promise objects. This was causing infinite re-renders, missing course/lesson data, and "lesson not found" errors when accessing lesson URLs directly.

## Debug Information

The console was showing errors like:

```
Debug info - courseId: undefined
Debug info - lessonId: undefined
Debug info - course exists: false
Debug info - courseLessons exists: false
```

Or showing "lesson not found" when directly accessing URLs like:
`http://localhost:3000/courses/eVpevoMNR2H46wliWRwH/lessons/3JPekGOLlq7CfkECdHNd`

These errors were repeating in an infinite loop, indicating that the components were re-rendering without properly resolving parameter values.

## Root Cause

The issue was occurring because of changes in how Next.js 15 passes route parameters to server components, particularly in the `generateMetadata` function and the main page component. The parameters could be passed either directly as an object or as a Promise, and the previous code wasn't handling both cases properly.

Additionally, the `ClientLessonWrapper.tsx` component was initially empty, causing the client-side rendering of lessons to fail.

## Changes Made

1. **In `app/courses/[courseId]/lessons/[lessonId]/page.tsx`:**

   - Enhanced the params handling with stronger typing
   - Added explicit String() conversion for params
   - Added additional debug logging
   - Fixed how params are passed to the client components
   - Implemented proper handling for both Promise and direct object params with a consistent pattern:

   ```tsx
   const courseId =
     typeof params === "object" && "courseId" in params
       ? String(params.courseId)
       : params instanceof Promise
       ? String((await params).courseId)
       : "";
   ```

2. **Added implementation to `components/Lesson/ClientLessonWrapper.tsx`:**

   - Created a robust client component that properly handles the lesson rendering
   - Added error handling and loading states
   - Implemented proper integration with the AppContext for accessing course and lesson data

3. **Updated `app/courses/[courseId]/page.tsx`:**

   - Applied the same parameter handling pattern for consistency across the application
   - Fixed potential issues with parameters in the `generateMetadata` function
   - Updated error handling and fallback paths

4. **In `components/Lesson/ClientLessonWrapper.tsx`:**

   - Created the previously missing component
   - Added proper client-side data fetching
   - Implemented loading state
   - Added error handling for missing lessons
   - Added navigation back to course when lessons aren't found

5. **In `components/Lesson/LessonDetailComponent.tsx`:**
   - Improved validation of params
   - Added early return with error message for invalid params
   - Enhanced debug logging
   - Improved conditional logic for fetching lessons

## Root Cause

Next.js 15 changed how dynamic route parameters work, making them Promise-like objects that need to be awaited before accessing their properties. This affected how parameters were passed from server components to client components.

Multiple issues were identified:

1. The ClientLessonWrapper.tsx file was empty despite being imported and used.
2. The params in page.tsx weren't being handled with instanceof Promise checks to handle both Promise and direct object cases.
3. The generateMetadata function had similar parameter handling issues.
4. Error handling in the fallback path wasn't properly handling Promise params.

## Future Prevention

When working with dynamic parameters in Next.js 15:

1. Always await params before accessing properties
2. Pass the resolved values, not the original params object, to client components
3. Add validation in client components to handle potential undefined values
4. Use explicit type conversion (String()) when needed
5. Include debug logging during development

## Related Changes

This fix relates to the previous "nextjs15-params-fix.md" documentation, extending it to handle nested dynamic routes with multiple parameters.
