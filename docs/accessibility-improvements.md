# Accessibility Improvements to Progress Components

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to Progress components throughout the Cursuri application.

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing infinite loop issues and accessibility warnings due to Progress components missing required accessibility attributes, specifically the `aria-label` attribute.

## Components Fixed

We identified and fixed the following Progress component instances:

1. **CourseEnrollment.tsx**

   - Added `aria-label="Course progress"` to the Progress component displaying course completion.

2. **LearningPathSection.tsx**

   - Added `aria-label="Current course progress"` to the Progress component displaying current course progress.
   - Added `aria-label="{node.name} course progress"` to the Progress component in the course node list.

3. **DashboardProgress.tsx**

   - Added `aria-label="Course completion progress"` to the first Progress component.
   - Added `aria-label="Lesson completion progress"` to the second Progress component.
   - Added `aria-label="Course completion percentage"` to the third Progress component.
   - Added `aria-label="Lesson completion percentage"` to the fourth Progress component.
   - Added `aria-label="{course.name} progress"` to individual course progress components.

4. **OfflineButton.tsx**

   - Added `aria-label="Download progress"` to the Progress component showing download status.

5. **Course/Lesson.tsx**
   - Added `aria-label="Video playback progress"` to the Progress component displaying video progress.

## Implementation Details

All Progress components from the HeroUI library now include the required `aria-label` attribute, which:

1. Improves accessibility for screen readers
2. Resolves infinite loop issues that were occurring due to missing accessibility attributes
3. Eliminates accessibility warnings in the console

## Benefits

These changes provide several benefits:

1. **Improved Accessibility**: Users with screen readers can now understand what each progress bar represents.
2. **Stability**: Fixed infinite loop issues caused by accessibility warnings.
3. **Better Practices**: Adheres to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.

## Future Considerations

When adding new Progress components, always include an appropriate `aria-label` attribute that describes what the progress bar is measuring. For example:

```tsx
<Progress
  value={75}
  aria-label="Download progress"
  // other props...
/>
```
