# Accessibility and Asset Fixes

This document records the accessibility and asset fixes applied to the Cursuri project.

## Improvements Made

### 1. React Components and Accessibility

- **HeroUI Component Fixes**:
  - Updated Button components in `AchievementsSection.tsx` to use `onPress` instead of `onClick` to conform with HeroUI best practices
  - Ensured all `Progress` components have proper `aria-label` attributes for accessibility

### 2. Asset Management

- **SVG Badge Files**:

  - Created badge SVG files in the `components/icons/svg` directory:
    - `BadgeFirstCourse.tsx`
    - `BadgeFiveLessons.tsx`
    - `BadgeTenLessons.tsx`
    - `BadgeThreeCourses.tsx`
    - `BadgeFiveCourses.tsx`
    - `BadgeFirstReview.tsx`
    - `BadgeLoginStreak7.tsx`
    - `BadgeLoginStreak30.tsx`
  - Created a `Badges.tsx` file to export all badge components
  - Updated the main index.ts file to export all badge components

- **Added AchievementBadge Component**:

  - Created a reusable `AchievementBadge` component that maps achievement IDs to their corresponding badge components
  - Updated the `AchievementsSection.tsx` component to use the new `AchievementBadge` component instead of static image URLs

- **Web App Manifest Assets**:
  - Added required Android Chrome icon assets for the web app manifest:
    - `android-chrome-192x192.png`
    - `android-chrome-512x512.png`
  - Added a favicon.ico file to the public directory

## Benefits

- **Improved Accessibility**: Screen readers can now properly identify and announce progress bars
- **Consistent Design Language**: Badge components now follow a consistent styling pattern
- **Better Asset Loading**: Progressive Web App (PWA) assets are now properly configured
- **No More 404 Errors**: Fixed missing asset errors in the browser console

## Future Improvements

- Convert remaining PNG files to optimized SVG components where appropriate
- Add proper badge descriptions in alt text for screen readers
- Consider adding sound effects or haptic feedback for achievement unlocking
